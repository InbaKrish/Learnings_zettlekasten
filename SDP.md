**Session Description Protocol**

![[Pasted image 20250514160358.png]]

**Text-based format** used to describe **multimedia communication sessions**.

It tells a remote peer **what kind of media** (audio, video, data) you want to send and receive, **how**, and **where**.

> ğŸ’¡ SDP is not a transport protocol â€” it **describes** a session but doesn't **transmit media**.
