### Title
Ruby on AI Race: Incorporating LLM Power into Ruby & Rails Applications

### Elevator Pitch
AI - Why Not Ruby? Dive into the AI revolution with Ruby! Learn to integrate AI into your Ruby/Rails apps using tools like LangChain and vector databases. This talk demystifies LLM-powered applications, showing how Ruby's LangChain makes AI integration accessible for all Rubyists.

### Description
We are in 2k24, When we talk about modern web applications/services, we can't ignore the AI part in it. Every products and tech giants incorporate the AI magics to their ecosystem to boost the user satisfaction and also for some show offs (offcourse boosting the sales and income). 

#### Why (not) Ruby?
When it comes to Ruby, it remains a outlier, especially when it comes to AI/ML or on the whole data science works.

Ruby and its community is mature and pragmatic, we hate re-inventing the wheel, the notion of **there's a gem for it** says it all. Recently, thereâ€™s a shift back to monolithic architecture as an alternative to microservices. In this context, Ruby on Rails stands as the Mjolnir of monolithic frameworks.

#### Hope for Rubyists
Despite the scare scenario of Ruby on AI race for the past decades, the community has acknowledged these limitations and has actively been working on creating and enhancing the AI requirements attracting more developers and companies to use Ruby in their AI/ML products (off-course added with all the Ruby magics). 

Currently specific use cases can leverage its strengths that align with requirements for applications like Chatbots, data analysis pipelines, content personalisation, supporting customer satisfactions and many more.

#### Langchainrb
Langchain is a framework that simplifies the integration of LLMs to the applitcations and interfaces to chain with lot of other integrations. This talks mainly focuses on the langchainrb gem, providing the LLM integration with top level abstractions.
