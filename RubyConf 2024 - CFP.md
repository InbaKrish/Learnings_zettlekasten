### Title
Ruby on AI Race: Incorporating LLM Power into Ruby & Rails Applications

### Elevator Pitch
AI - Why Not Ruby? Dive into the AI revolution with Ruby! Learn to integrate AI into your Ruby/Rails apps using tools like LangChain and vector databases. This talk demystifies LLM-powered applications, showing how Ruby's LangChain makes AI integration accessible for all Rubyists.

### Description
In 2024, AI is a cornerstone of modern web applications and services. From enhancing user experiences to driving sales, tech giants integrate AI to captivate users and boost their bottom lines.

#### Why (not) Ruby?
Ruby has often been seen as an outlier in the AI and data science domains. Despite its mature and pragmatic community, and the mantra "there's a gem for that," Ruby has lagged in AI/ML advancements. 
However, there's a resurgence of interest in monolithic architectures, with Ruby on Rails emerging as a robust framework in this area, akin to Mjolnir in its strength and utility.

#### Hope for Rubyists
Despite the scare scenario of Ruby on AI race for the past decades, the community has acknowledged these limitations and has actively been working on creating and enhancing the AI requirements attracting more developers and companies to use Ruby in their AI/ML products (off-course added with all the Ruby magics). 

Currently specific use cases can leverage its strengths that align with requirements for applications like Chatbots, data analysis pipelines, content personalisation, supporting customer satisfactions and many more.

#### Langchainrb
One exciting development is [Langchainrb](https://github.com/patterns-ai-core/langchainrb)—a framework that simplifies the integration of large language models (LLMs) into applications. This talk will explore Langchainrb, highlighting its top-level abstractions and practical use cases. As Langchainrb evolves rapidly, it’s an excellent time for Rubyists to delve into its capabilities.

Whether you’re an experienced developer or curious about AI’s intersection with Ruby, this talk will equip you with the insights and tools needed to confidently engage in the AI revolution.

## Notes
With over 3 years of experience in Ruby and Rails, combined with a strong interest in technological advancements and AI, I am well-equipped to guide attendees through this dynamic topic. My background includes hands-on projects and research involving vector databases and large language models (LLMs) within the Ruby ecosystem.

This session will feature interactive elements such as live code demos and a Q&A segment to keep the audience engaged and provide valuable, actionable insights. I look forward to sharing practical knowledge and sparking discussions about the future of AI in the Ruby community.

**Technical Requirements**: A projector for live coding demonstrations, and internet access to showcase integrations and examples.


## Bio
I'm a fresh Rubyist, with very much interest and passion towards Ruby & Rails as soon as I got into it. Currently got interests with the AI, exploring the Ruby ways of integrating the capabulities into it. I'm pretty much work on databse optimizations, R&D of new Rails & Ruby features into our applications in my company projects, working with IoT field. 

I may not spoken any public tech talks till date, but have given many internal webinars on various Rails features like actioncables, Turbo, vector databases, LLMs, and devcontainer setup for internal Rails applications to name a few.

Oh, **one directoin member?**, this made me google this part, as I'm not sure about the **One Direction** band till date. But I like our in-home **AR Rahman**.
