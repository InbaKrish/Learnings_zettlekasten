### Title
Ruby on AI Race: Incorporating LLM Power into Ruby & Rails Applications

### Elevator Pitch
AI - Why Not Ruby? Dive into the AI revolution with Ruby! Learn to integrate AI into your Ruby/Rails apps using tools like LangChain and vector databases. This talk demystifies LLM-powered applications, showing how Ruby's LangChain makes AI integration accessible for all Rubyists.

### Description
In 2024, AI is a cornerstone of modern web applications and services. From enhancing user experiences to driving sales, tech giants integrate AI to captivate users and boost their bottom lines.

#### Why (not) Ruby?
Ruby has often been seen as an outlier in the AI and data science domains. Despite its mature and pragmatic community, and the mantra "there's a gem for that," Ruby has lagged in AI/ML advancements. 
However, there's a resurgence of interest in monolithic architectures, with Ruby on Rails emerging as a robust framework in this area, akin to Mjolnir in its strength and utility.

#### Hope for Rubyists
Despite the scare scenario of Ruby on AI race for the past decades, the community has acknowledged these limitations and has actively been working on creating and enhancing the AI requirements attracting more developers and companies to use Ruby in their AI/ML products (off-course added with all the Ruby magics). 

Currently specific use cases can leverage its strengths that align with requirements for applications like Chatbots, data analysis pipelines, content personalisation, supporting customer satisfactions and many more.

#### Langchainrb
One exciting development is [Langchainrb](https://github.com/patterns-ai-core/langchainrb)—a framework that simplifies the integration of large language models (LLMs) into applications. This talk will explore Langchainrb, highlighting its top-level abstractions and practical use cases. As Langchainrb evolves rapidly, it’s an excellent time for Rubyists to delve into its capabilities.

Whether you’re an experienced developer or curious about AI’s intersection with Ruby, this talk will equip you with the insights and tools needed to confidently engage in the AI revolution.

## Notes
With my interest and expertise over Ruby and Rails for the past 3+ years, with eagerness to dwelve into tech advancements and AI domains, and excitement to guide the attendees through this trendy topic, makes me well suited. To add on I have worked on some projects and researches over the vector databases and LLMs with Ruby ecosystem.

This session includes interactive elements like live demos with codes and a Q&A session ensuring that the audience remains engaged and leaves with valuable, actionable insights.
