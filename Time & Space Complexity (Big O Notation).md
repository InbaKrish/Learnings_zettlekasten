How running time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input data.

O(1) - constant 
O(log n) - logarithmic
O(n) - linear
O(n log n) - Linearthmic
O(n^2) - quadratic
O(2^n) - exponential
O(n!) - factorial

## Notation types

Big O - Upper bound (worst case)
Big Ω - lower bound (best case)
Big Θ (theta) - Tight bound (average case)

-> For method call stacks, that will add up to the space complexity, like for recursive functions each method calls under the stack adds up to the space complexity, therefore `n` method recursive calls in the stack adds to the complexity as `O(n)`.
