Tags - [[Cryptography]] [[Hashing Functions]]

Function/Algorithm to convert any data of any format to a fixed length identifier.
-> One way - can create hash with the data but can retrieve the data with the hash value (hash/digest)
-> Fixed length (based on the algorithm SHA-256 (256 bits), SHA-512 (512 bits))
-> Every data will have a uniq hash value and do not collide (same date will have the same digest)
-> Examples - SHA - 256,512,1(not in use), MD5
