## Dirty Read

One transaction's query reads uncommitted data altered from other transactions.

## Non-Repeatable Read

Within a transaction the read value gets changed based on other transaction modifications.

```ruby
product_id = 1

# T1
Product.transaction do
  initial_price = Product.find(product_id).price
  puts "Transaction 1: Initial read price is #{initial_price}"

  # T2
  Thread.new do
    Product.transaction do
      product = Product.find(product_id)
      product.update(price: initial_price + 100)
      puts "Transaction 2: Updated price to #{product.price}"
    end
  end.join

  sleep(3)

  # T1
  final_price = Product.find(product_id).price
  puts "Transaction 1: Re-read price is #{final_price}"
end

#=> Transaction 1: Initial read price is 200
#=> Transaction 2: Updated price to 300
#=> Transaction 1: Re-read price is 300
```

## Phantom Reads

Due to addition or insertion on other transaction matching the same criteria on another read query transaction (say count), it varies.

```ruby
# T1
Product.transaction do
  minimum_price = 100
  initial_count = Product.where("price > ?", minimum_price).count
  puts "Transaction 1: Initial count of products exceeding #{minimum_price} is #{initial_count}"

  # T2
  Thread.new do
    Product.transaction do
      Product.create(price: minimum_price + 50) # This creates a new product that meets the condition
      puts "Transaction 2: Added a new product exceeding #{minimum_price}"
    end
  end.join

  sleep(3)

  # T1
  final_count = Product.where("price > ?", minimum_price).count
  puts "Transaction 1: Re-count of products exceeding #{minimum_price} is #{final_count}"
end

#=> Transaction 1: Initial count of products exceeding 100 is 1
#=> Transaction 2: Added a new product exceeding 100
#=> Transaction 1: Re-count of products exceeding 100 is 2
```
