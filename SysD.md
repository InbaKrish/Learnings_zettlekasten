Given a set of requirements (say building a facebook),
-> decide architecture (what are the things require at top level say DBs, CDNs, Servers, etc,.)
-> decide components (say a component takes care of auth, then what are the components say how much server, what kind of servers, DB, etc,.)
-> decide modules
additionally how these components and modules interact between each other.
