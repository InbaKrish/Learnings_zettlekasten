AI - Branch of computer science making machines think and have human like behaviours
ML - learn pattern from data and make predictions
NN - mimic human brain 
DL - subset of NN, to solve complex problems
GenAI - generative dynamic content based on the patterns learnt
LLM - form of GenAI, generates human like text from the extensive textual data

## Foundation Models
Lies at the core of GenAI. Generates data out of simple input data. (eg: ChatGPT)
Trained using [[Supervised Learning]] (using data with corresponding labels)

Look Ups - [[Markov Chain]], which is an early example of GenAI and GAN ([General Adversarial Networks](https://areganti.notion.site/Week-1-Part-1-Applied-LLM-Foundations-and-Real-World-Use-Cases-3f381d027e0041739fec6178d3f8aa18#:~:text=The%20landscape%20has,of%20generated%20content.))
